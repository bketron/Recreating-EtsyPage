Select your options from the drop down menu.\n2.

With such a fast turnaround time, I usually start designing your custom piece within hours from when the order is placed. For that reason I am unfortunately unable to accommodate changes to the order or shipping address once it has been placed.\n\nMobile phones do not allow selection from drop down menus. Please provide your choices in the &quot;notes&quot; section at checkout if you have a preference. \n\nPlease note that not providing required information at checkout may delay your order. Processing time begins when all required information is submitted. Digital proofs are available upon request.

However, due to my fast turnaround time, they are usually engraved the morning after the order is placed. If your order has been engraved, it will be shipped and ineligible for a cancellation or a refund.\n\nAs each custom piece is made to order just for you, understandably I cannot accept returns. Please make sure to ask any questions that you have before placing the order.\n\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\n\n\n...EXPEDITED SHIPPING...\n\nAvailable by special request.

We check each glass prior to engraving for any noticeable flaws. As each glass is completely unique, please allow for small imperfections on the surface of the glass.\n\nLAYOUTS ~ We will try to honor all engraving requests, however there are some instances where a layout may not work as requested. We retain the right to use our discretion to make slight changes as needed.\n\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING POLICY\nIMPORTANT:\nDue to the changes in USPS International Shipping Policies, Orders that are deemed un-deliverable by the carrier or are not picked up in the allotted amount of time will be treated as abandoned.

This shop does not sell any physical prints -- just the files.\n\n►Why would I want a digital printable file instead of a physical print?\nDigital prints = print at your convenience, as many times as you want! No shipping fees, and no waiting days and days for your print to arrive. Print the size you want (within the same aspect ratio), on the material you want (paper, board, metal, etc). Because the file is emailed to you, you can have the final product in your hands much faster than if purchasing a hard-copy! Need it really fast? Print at a one-hour photo lab - you could potentially have your order printed the same day you order it! Also, create photo gifts with your digital prints, add them to photo books, share on social media, etc!\n\n►Do you ever offer discounts or coupon codes?\nYes, but you must &quot;like&quot; me on Facebook to receive promotions & sales for my shop, as well as to photo labs!\nfacebook.com/MAonEtsy\n\n►Can the shop call me if I have questions?\n{PRINTS} by MA Design can be contacted via Etsy Conversation. The shop DOES NOT communicate via telephone (call or text).\n\n►My print lab is asking for a Print Release form. What is that, and how do I get it?\nFirst of all, a print release form is sent with every single order - check the email you received with your order. A Print Release Form grants the buyer permission (a release) from the print owner (the shop) to print images provided. It does not include rights to edit or alter the image, sell them, etc. That right remains with the print owner (the shop).\n\n\n----- INSTANT DOWNLOAD FAQS -----\n►What exactly is an Instant Download digital printable file?\nInstant Download digital printable files are prints that will be delivered to you via Etsy and that you print on your own. What you receive is exactly what is seen in the previews. No changes can be made since these files are pre-loaded into Etsy and sent to the customer from Etsy (not from the shop). Check out this article for more info on Instant Downloads: https://www.etsy.com/help/article/3949\n• Customer will receive an email from Etsy with their download link as soon as payment clears\n• Due to the nature of instant download digital images, all sales are final and no refunds and/or exchanges will be given.\n\n►I like one of your Instant Download digital printable files, but I want to make some changes to it. Can that be done?\nNo changes can be made to Instant Downloads. But for almost every Instant Download that I have in my shop, there is a custom version available as well!\n\n►Where are Instant Downloads sent? Can I give the shop a different email address to use?\nInstant Downloads are sent via Etsy (not the shop) to the email address linked to the customer&#39;s Etsy account. No other email address can be used since it&#39;s sent directly from Etsy. Please make sure the email address you use for Etsy is working and you can access it. Check out this article for more info on Instant Downloads: https://www.etsy.com/help/article/3949\n\n►I can&#39;t find the email that was sent to me from Etsy with my Instant Download. How else can I access the file?\nInstant Downloads can be access under &quot;Purchases&quot; in your Etsy account. Check out this article for more info on Instant Downloads: https://www.etsy.com/help/article/3949\n\n\n----- CUSTOM ORDER FAQS -----\n►Once I receive the email with my custom digital print, can I just take my phone to the print lab and then they can pull it off of my phone?\nYou can&#39;t simply take your phone to a print lab and expect the clerk to be able to pull the file from your phone/email. The file must be downloaded to your computer and then either uploaded to a photo lab website or transferred to a flash drive to take into a store. Often times for liability reasons, print lab clerks can&#39;t touch your phone.\n\n►How will I receive my custom digital printable fie?\n• Custom orders are sent via Google Drive to the email address linked to the customer&#39;s Etsy account. Be sure to DOWNLOAD the file -- don’t simply save the preview (the download button will be at the top center of the screen after you click the name of your file). My digital prints are all high resolution and larger than they need to be in order to print high quality. If your print appears blurry, please go back and make sure you downloaded it correctly. I never send low-res files, so your print will not be blurry if you are printing the size you ordered (or smaller).\n• Instant Download files are pre-loaded into Etsy, and sent to the customer from Etsy (not from the shop) to the email address linked to their Etsy account.\n\n►I&#39;d like to receive a proof prior to the final version of the digital printable file please.\n*PROOFS ARE BY REQUEST ONLY*\nIf you want to see a proof prior to receiving the final print, you must request one. If a digital proof is requested, it will be sent through Etsy Conversations after ALL information is received. Once the proof approval is received, the final high-res digital file will be emailed ASAP.\n• Proofing includes checking spelling, changing a color, and other minor changes. Proofing a file does NOT include changing the size of a print, changing the information to create a completely new print, rearranging the print, changing any text (not pertaining to the customer&#39;s custom info), adding additional information that would require reworking the print, or anything else major.\n• Two (2) free proofs/revisions are included in your purchase. Additional revisions are $5 each and can be purchased here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/228710896/extra-revision-additional-proof?ref=shop_home_active_1\n• Proofs are provided for custom prints only (not Instant Downloads)\n\n►I want a custom digital printable file, but don&#39;t see what I&#39;m looking for in your shop. Can you create something for me?\nContact the shop about a custom print - there&#39;s a good chance the shop can make you one!\n• Give the shop at least a 7-day notice for all custom orders.\n• {PRINTS} by MA Design will not produce any work with copyrighted or licensed imagery or text.\n\n\n----- PRINTING FAQs -----\n►How do I print the digital printable file once I receive it?\nPrint your digital file just like you would a photograph! Simply download the print to your computer (make sure you DOWNLOAD it, and don&#39;t just save the preview image), then you can....\n• Print it at home (depending on the paper size, of course)\n• Send the print to your favorite photo lab to print (see below for suggestions)\n• Save to a USB thumb-drive and take to your local print store to be printed\n\n►How many times can I print my digital printable file?\nSince you&#39;re receiving a digital print, and not a physical one, you can print it as many times as you want!!\n*Digital files are for personal use only. You are welcome to print it for yourself or as a gift, but you CAN NOT resell it in part or whole - either in a digital or printed format.\n\n►What media can I print my digital print on?\nPrint on any media you&#39;d like!\n• photo poster\n• poster board\n• poster then mount it to a board\n• canvas*\n• photo books\n• photo gifts (mousepads, coffee mugs, phone covers, magnets, greeting cards, etc)\n• share on social media\nThe possibilities are endless with digital files! (and so are the number of times you use it)\n*If you want to print on a canvas, the add-on must be purchased at the same time as purchasing your print to change the print size to a canvas since extra space is required for a wrap -- https://www.etsy.com/listing/261240148/enlarge-for-canvas-enlarge-a-print-to\n\n►What paper finish should I choose?\nWhen printing a chalkboard, choose a matte, luster, or a similar non-glossy finish (glossy can create a glare, darken colors, and will pick up finger prints).\n\n►I&#39;m stumped on colors. Can you make any suggestions?\nLighter colors (for the text) works best against the dark chalkboard background. For samples of different color scheme examples, I suggest this website: http://design-seeds.com/ If you find one you like, send me the link.\n\n►I&#39;m going to use my digital print as a photo prop. Do you have any suggestions?\nIf framing a photo prop, place the print in front of the glass to help reduce the glare. Definitely make sure that a non-glossy finish is chosen when printing to help reduce glare.\n\n\n----- PRINT LAB FAQS -----\n►What will it cost to print a digital printable file?\nThe cost will depend on a LOT of factors -- the print lab, media (poster, poster board, etc), size, how fast you need it, if you choose a local one-hour lab or have to pay for shipping, if you use coupon codes or sales, etc.\n\n►When uploading my image to a print lab, I have different upload speeds to choose from. Which should I choose?\nIf you&#39;re given a choice of upload speeds when uploading your print to a photo lab website, NEVER CHOOSE THE FAST OPTION! This will reduce the quality of the print since they are very large. By default, the fast upload option is often selected, so make sure you choose the option for large prints.\n**This is especially true for Walmart.com! Walmart.com automatically has the &quot;fast upload&quot; option selected, which will reduce the quality of the print. Make sure you check the &quot;Large print upload&quot; option instead.\n\n►I tried downloading my digital print to my phone, but it&#39;s not working correctly. Please help!\n📵 DON&#39;T DOWNLOAD TO YOUR PHONE! The files are large (since they&#39;re high-resolution), and sometimes when saving to a phone the phone converts it into a smaller file. Always download your print to a computer to then upload to a photo lab, or transfer to a flash-drive.\n\n►I tried uploading my file to a print lab to be printed, but I received a &quot;low resolution&quot; warning. Please help!\n• For custom prints, make sure that you DOWNLOAD the file -- don’t simply save the preview (the download button will be at the top center of the screen after you click the name of your file). All of my digital prints are high resolution and larger than they need to be in order to print high quality. If your print appears blurry, please go back and make sure you downloaded it correctly.\n• I only sell high-res files, so your print will not be blurry if you are printing the size you ordered (or smaller).\n• If you&#39;re given a choice of upload speeds when uploading your print to a photo lab website, NEVER CHOOSE THE FAST OPTION! This will reduce the quality of the print since they are very large. By default, the fast upload option is often selected, so make sure you choose the option for large prints.\n**This is especially true for Walmart.com! Walmart.com automatically has the &quot;fast upload&quot; option selected, which will reduce the quality of the print. Make sure you check the &quot;Large print upload&quot; option instead.\n\n►I can&#39;t print my digital print at home, but don&#39;t know which photo lab to choose. Can you suggest one?\nThere are many options for printing your digital files, but here are a few suggestions:\n\n• Costco is by far the most popular store that my customers choose to print their digital prints (and one of my favorites!). They have numerous options at very reasonable prices! &quot;Poster Prints&quot; and &quot;Poster Boards&quot; are two favorites! Poster Boards are a great way to display photo props, wedding signs, birthday boards, anniversary boards, etc. with no frame needed! And most of Costco&#39;s printing options are available in one hour (depending on the location)!!! People always appear to be very pleased with the result from &gt; printing, and I myself have used them to print my own prints and poster boards!\nThe only drawback is you must have a Costco membership to be able to print there.\n\n• Mpix.com is one of my favorite places for printing digital images, especially photos, faux-chalkboards, wall art, etc. The quality is fantastic, yet the price is reasonable. They have many different options when it comes to paper and finishes (true black & white, pearl finish, metallic finish, etc.). To print your digital file, all you need to do is upload your JPG to their website. The only drawback is that you have to wait a few days for your prints to arrive in the mail. Before ordering, be sure to look online for coupon codes! :)\n\n• VistaPrint.com is another very popular and reliable online retailer for printing everything from invitations to posters! Always search for a coupon code before placing your purchase -- there are a ton available online, you just have to find them!\n\n• Shutterfly.com and Snapfish.com are very popular and reliable online resources for printing digital files, especially cards and invitations. One of the best parts is that they trim the cards for you and offer free matching envelopes! Your stationery will turn out looking very professional without a hefty price tag.\nPlus Shutterfly always seems to be having a sale! The only drawback, like Mpix, is that you have to wait for your order to arrive in the mail.\n\n• One-hour photo labs also offer a variety of printing options and price ranges, with the convenience of fast printing. You may be limited to only glossy finishes, and have to purchase envelopes separately if you&#39;re printing invitations. But if you need something fast, one-hour photo labs are definitely a good option! Some examples are Costco, Sam’s Club, Walmart, Wallgreens, Rite Aid, etc.\n\n• Office supply stores are also a great option! Some require a PDF for printing rather than a JPG, so please check this before placing your order -- if you need a PDF just let me know and I can give you that format instead.\n**Staples can print B&W prints at a VERY reasonable price!!!!\n\n\n----- INVITATION FAQS -----\n►I need some help with printing invitations. Please help!\nIt is best to print invitations as actual invitations so that you receive envelopes, rather than just printing the invites as a photograph. Suggestions of print labs include Shutterfly.com and VistaPrint.com.\n\n►How do I print an invitation?\nIt is best to print invitations as actual invitations so that you receive envelopes, rather than just printing the invites as a photograph. Some suggestions of print labs that print invitations and stationary include Shutterfly.com, Zazzle.com, and VistaPrint.com.\n\n► I want to print cards through Vista Print, but their dimensions are 5.59&quot; x 4.33&quot;.\n5.59&quot; x 4.33&quot; is the same aspect ratio as 5x7&quot;, so any 5x7&quot; digital printable file should work just fine!\n*This shop is not responsible for printing errors caused by the buyer not setting up their print correctly when printed.\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n----- ADDITIONAL SHOP POLICES -----\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\n---- GENERAL POLICIES -----\n-------------------------------------\n\n---- HOURS OF OPERATION -----\n{PRINTS} by MA Design operates from 8am - 5pm EST, Monday - Friday (although emails may be responded to outside this time frame since it can be done from a phone).

Orders placed after 5pm EST or on a weekend or national holiday count as being placed at 8am the following business day.\n{PRINTS} by MA Design is closed on all weekends and national holidays.\n\n----- PROOFS -----\n*PROOFS ARE BY REQUEST ONLY*\n• If a customer wants to see a proof prior to receiving the final print, they must request one.

Additional revisions are $5 each and can be purchased here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/228710896/extra-revision-additional-proof?ref=shop_home_active_1\n• Proofs are provided for custom prints only (not Instant Downloads)\n\n----- FAILURE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION -----\nIf any/all of the customization information is not provided for an order and the customer has been contacted via Etsy Conversation in search of the customization information, and the final ship date has arrived, the custom order will either be:\n1) completed with any information that was provided\n2) canceled and refunded minus the 10% cancellation fee\nThis will be determined by what item is ordered. If a generic version is able to be provided (Ex: a Happy Birthday poster), this will be sent. But if the item requires customization information (Ex: wedding schedule sign), then the order will be canceled.\n• The ship date will not be extended due to a customer not supplying the required customization information.\n• If the customer requests major changes to their order after it had been sent, a new purchase must be made (see below).\n\n----- ORDER IS FINAL AFTER IT IS SENT -----\nOnce an order is sent, no major changes can be made to the print. If a customer requests changes (not including minor changes, such as spelling errors), a new purchase must be made since the customer is already in possession of the digital file they purchased. Making major changes would mean a new product is being made, and therefor a new purchase must be made.\n\n----- PLACE YOUR ORDER EARLY -----\nPlease make sure you are ordering your print well in advance. Receiving your final digital print will depend on how quickly I receive all of your information, and how fast the proof approval process goes (if applicable). {PRINTS} by MA Design is not responsible for orders that do not arrive on time due to circumstances outside my control (ex: customer placing an order too late, a customer&#39;s email not working, etc). No refunds/exchanges will be given for orders that do not arrive on time due to technical issues.\n\n----- DIGITAL PRINT SIZES -----\nThe size of each digital print is listed in the Item Details section of the listing. If you need a different size than what is offered, please purchase the appropriate add-on option IN ADDITION TO your desired digital print - https://www.etsy.com/listing/228530271/change-the-size-of-a-print-that-is-in-my\nOnce a print is emailed, the sale is considered final. If a different size is required after a print is emailed, the entire purchase must be remade.\n\n----- PREVIEW IMAGES -----\nThe preview images are low-resolution, but you will receive a high-resolution, quality image that is suitable for printing. You will NOT receive any printed products. Only DIGITAL FILES are sold -- nothing physical (no prints, frames, mats, wooden backgrounds, etc.).\n\n----- COLORS MAY VARY -----\nBecause colors may vary between your screen and the actual printed product, the shop cannot be held responsible if you are unhappy with the printed product. All screens display color differently; so please take this into consideration when placing your order. No refunds will be given after an order is sent. Please see the Refund Policy section for more information.\n\n----- CUSTOMIZED FILES ARE DELETED AFTER 14 DAYS ----\nAll customized files will be saved on my computer for editing purposes for fourteen (14) days from the date of shipment/email. After 14 days they will be deleted. If any changes need to be made to an order that was sent more than 14 days ago, the digital printable file must be repurchased since all work must be completely redone.\n\n---- CONTACTING THE SHOP -----\n{PRINTS} by MA Design can be contacted via Etsy Conversation or email (printsbymadesign@gmail.com) only. The shop DOES NOT communicate via telephone (call or text).\n\n----- FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY -----\nDigital files are for personal use only. You are welcome to print it for yourself or as a gift, but you CAN NOT resell it in part or whole - either in a digital or printed format.\n\n---- SHOP IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CUSTOMER ERROR -----\n{PRINTS} by MA Design is not responsible for customers not being able to print their digital file(s) due to customer error.\nThis is because:\n• all files are higher resolution than what is required for printing a high-quality print.\n• the shop provides many tips, instructions, suggestions, etc on printing the print.\n• detailed instructions are provided on downloading the print correctly, so the shop is not responsible for customers not being able to download their print successfully.\n\nThe shop is not responsible for prints not turning out well due to customer error, such as:\n- colors chosen by customer are too dark/light when printed\n- prints being printed too small\n- prints being printed on a material that distorts the image (ex: burlap)\n- prints being saved incorrectly (not downloaded), and therefor blurry\n- prints being printed at an aspect ratio not relative to the print purchased (ie: image is cropped incorrectly)\n- any typos (typos will be corrected, but the shop is not responsible for any PRINTED files)\nNote - Digital printable files sold by this shop are for personal use only. You are welcome to print it for yourself or as a gift, but you CAN NOT resell it in part or whole - either in a digital or printed format.\n\n\n----- &quot;SHIPPING&quot; -----\n---------------------------\n\n----- DIGITAL PRINTABLE FILES ONLY -----\nThis shop only sells digital printable files -- nothing physical! So no need for physical shipping, shipping fees, or waiting days and days for just one item! All images are in JPEG format (PDF available upon request), high resolution, and suitable for printing. Unlimited printing permitted for personal use only. Only DIGITAL PRINTABLE FILES are sold in this shop – nothing physical will be sent.\n\n----- INSTANT DOWNLOADS -----\n• Instant Download digital printable files come as seen in the previews. No changes can be made to these files.\n• Instant Download files are pre-loaded into Etsy, and sent to the customer from Etsy (not from the shop).\n• If you have a question about an Instant Download, contact the shop prior to purchase. If you write a note in the &quot;Note to Seller&quot; box at check out, the shop will not automatically receive that note.\n\n----- CUSTOM DIGITAL FILES ARE EMAILED -----\nCustomized orders will be sent to the email linked to the customer&#39;s Etsy account. A message is sent to the customer via Etsy as soon as an order is sent. {PRINTS} by MA Design is not responsible for emails that cannot be received on time due to circumstances beyond my control (ex: email addresses that are undeliverable, addresses that are no longer in use, etc). A download link is included in Etsy Shipment Notification, so the customer actually receives their order in two ways (via email and via Etsy Notification download link). The download link can always be accessed in the customer&#39;s &quot;Purchases&quot;.\n\n\n---- REFUNDS - EXCHANGES - CANCELLATIONS -----\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- INSTANT DOWNLOADS -----\n• Instant Download digital printable files come as seen in the previews. No changes can be made to these files since they are pre-loaded into Etsy and sent to the customer from Etsy (not from the shop).\n• Due to the nature of instant download digital images, all sales are final. If any files have been downloaded, absolutely no refunds and/or exchanges will be given! This is because there is no way the digital file can be returned to the shop.\n• The shop is not responsible for customers purchasing an Instant Download digital printable file that they didn&#39;t intend to (ex: the wrong pregnancy due date month, wrong birthday poster year, etc). No refunds or exchanges will be provided since the listings clearly states what is for sale.\nInstant Downloads come exactly see seen in the preview image.\n\n----- CUSTOMIZED ORDERS -----\nCustom orders can only be cancelled within 1 hour of the order being placed.\n*No refunds or cancellations and/or refunds due to the customer not realizing that what they purchased is a digital printable file. This is not the fault of the shop since it is made clear MANY times throughout the store.\n• ALL SALES ARE CONSIDERED FINAL when an order is sent (via email) - no refunds and/or exchanges will be given.\n• The shop will send an order within the posted turn-around time frame, unless a &quot;Rush Order&quot; add-on is purchased in addition to a print. The shop is not responsible for customers failing to have their print printed in a timely manner (ex: customer forgetting to have a birthday poster printed before a party).\n\n\nThank you for visiting {PRINTS} by MA Design!\nPRINTSbyMAdesign.etsy.com\n\n© {PRINTS} by MA Design - All Rights Reserved.",

This shop does not sell any physical prints.\n\nDigital printable files = print at your convenience, as many times as you want! No shipping fees, or worrying about anything getting damaged/lost in the mail. Choose where you want to have it printed (very cost effective) - print at a one-hour photo lab & you could potentially have it in your hands within hours of purchasing it! Print any size within the same aspect ratio, on the material you want (paper, poster board, canvas, metal, etc). Also, create photo gifts with your digital prints, add them to photo books, share on social media, etc!\n\nPRINTING INFO & TIPS\nPrint your digital printable file as many times as you want! Print different sizes (within the same aspect ratio), add to photo books, create photo gifts, share on social media, etc!\n*Digital files are for personal use only. You are welcome to print it for yourself or as a gift, but you CAN NOT resell it in part or whole - either in a digital or printed format.\n\nPrint your digital print just like a photograph (on white paper).  I suggest having it printed to save your printer ink!  Costco and Mpix.com are my two favorite places to print, but there are numerous other fantastic sources!  For a LOT of printing tips & info, please see the “ABOUT” section of my shop: https://www.etsy.com/shop/PRINTSbyMAdesign/about\n\nPRINT QUALITY INFORMATION\nPrints are High Resolution & High Quality. If you receive a LOW RESOLUTION warning, please see below:\n• CUSTOM PRINTS: make sure you DOWNLOAD the file - don’t simply save the preview (the download button will be at the top center of the screen after you click the name of your file). \n• My digital prints are high resolution & larger than they need to be in order to print high quality. If your print appears blurry, please go back and make sure you downloaded it correctly.\n• If you&#39;re given a choice of upload speeds when uploading, NEVER CHOOSE THE FAST OPTION! This will reduce the quality of the print since they are very large. By default, the fast upload option is often selected, so make sure you choose the option for large prints.\n\nPRINT RELEASE & POSTING TO SOCIAL MEDIA INFO\nA Print Release Form grants the buyer permission (a release) from the print owner (the shop) to print images provided. It does not include rights to edit or alter the image, sell them, etc. That right remains with the print owner (the shop).  A print release form is sent with every single order - check the email you received with your order.\n\nIf you post any digital files purchased from my shop to social media, please give me credit by using the web address PRINTSbyMAdesign.etsy.com and the hashtag #PRINTSbyMAdesign\n\nINSTANT DOWNLOAD INFORMATION\nInstant Download digital printable files are prints that are delivered via Etsy and printed by the buyer. What is received is exactly what is seen in the previews - no changes can be made since these files are pre-loaded into Etsy & sent to the customer from Etsy (not from the shop). \n• Download links are sent from Etsy (not the seller) to the email address linked to the buyer&#39;s Etsy account as soon as payment clears. No files will be emailed separately by the shop. Also access the download link under &quot;Purchases&quot; https://www.etsy.com/your/purchases\n• For more info: https://www.etsy.com/help/article/3949\n• ALL SALES ARE FINAL - no cancellations, refunds, or exchanges.\n\nPROOFS ARE BY REQUEST ONLY\n• Proofs must be requested on an order (in the Note to Seller box).\n• Proofs are only sent through Etsy Conversations after ALL info is received. The final high-res digital file will be emailed ASAP once the proof is approved.\n• Proofing includes minor changes only (es: spelling error). Proofing does NOT include major changes, including, but not limited to: resizing, creating a completely new print, changing any text (not pertaining to the customer&#39;s custom info), rearranging or reworking the design, etc. \n• 2 free proofs per custom order. Additional revisions can be purchased here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/228710896/extra-revision-additional-proof\n• Proofs are sent after payment clears\n• Proofs are provided for custom orders only\n\nFILE TYPES - JPG, PDF, BLEED, ETC\nJPGs and PDFs are two different types of digital files.  The only reason why you&#39;d need one vs the other is because different print labs require different file types. Most print labs require JPGs, and therefore this shop sends JPGs unless a PDF is requested.  If you need a PDF, it must be requested when the order is placed.  If you need to have a bleed around your print (your print lab will tell you this), this must be requested at the time of the sale.\n\nDIGITAL PRINTABLE FILES ONLY - NO PHYSICAL PRINTS\nNO PHYSICAL ITEMS WILL BE SENT! Once your digital printable file(s) has been sent to you via email, you will receive a &quot;shipping confirmation&quot;. This confirmation is only to verify that your order has been completed (nothing will be sent to your physical address). If you have not received the email with your download link, yet you know it was sent, please check your spam folder. Completed orders can also be accessed under &quot;Purchases&quot;: https://www.etsy.com/your/purchases\n\nALL SALES ARE FINAL - NO CANCELLATIONS OR REFUNDS.\nNO CANCELLATIONS or REFUNDS\n\nPer Etsy&#39;s Terms of Use, customers are responsible for reading all Item Descriptions and Shop Policies prior to purchase: https://www.etsy.com/legal/buyers/?ref=list#purchasing\n\nBy purchasing from this shop, you acknowledge and agree to the Shop Policies and Terms of Use.\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/PRINTSbyMAdesign?ref=hdr_shop_menu#policies\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/PRINTSbyMAdesign/about\n\nExchanges *MAY* be possible for custom orders only - not on Instant Downloads.

Then you will see a Download button to the right of your purchase.\n\nPlease contact me if you have any issue in downloading. Or here is Etsy&#39;s page of helpful instructions: https://www.etsy.com/help/article/3949\n\nHOW DO I PRINT MY ARTWORK?\nPrintable wall art can be printed at home or sent out to your favorite photo printing service.\n\nUse the PDF version to easily print at home for smaller prints.\n\nUse the JPG to upload to online printing services such as Shutterfly or Costco.\n\nI recommend using a White Matte thick photo paper for both black and white and color artwork and images. If you like a little shine use the Luster paper, Glossy tends to be too shiny and detracts from your print.\n\nWHAT TYPE OF FILES WILL I RECEIVE?\nFor most prints you will receive JPG and PDF versions of the image. For some prints with a lot of &quot;imagery&quot; the PDF is too large to upload on Etsy. Just contact me if you would like a PDF to be sent.\n\nSizes vary, but many prints include:\n5x7   PDF\n8x10 PDF\n11x14 PDF\n16x20 JPG\n\nWHAT CAN I DO WITH MY PRINT?\nFrame it! Display it!\n\nYou may print as many copies as you wish for your personal use. This file is for non-commercial PERSONAL USE ONLY. You may not forward, share, sell or distribute the file.

I strive for excellent customer service and providing the best products possible.  Because all of the items available for purchase are made by hand and not in a factory, no two products are the same.  This provides each customer with a truly unique product every time.  Slight imperfections and subtle differences may be noticed on certain products.  However, no products are ever sold or shipped without a generous consideration for quality.",
        "policy_payment": "Payment methods include Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover credit or debit and money order.  Orders will not be made until payment is received.  Taxes will be automatically applied at checkout.  Cancellation requests must be received within 3 hours after the order has been placed to be considered. After 3 hours, your order will be already in production. This process can not be reversed and no cancellations, returns, or refunds will be granted. Please purchase responsibly.  All orders must be paid in full before production and/or shipment.  Requests for cancellation of personalized products will be denied if the production on that order has begun at the time of the request regardless of the time in which it is received. A 25% convenience fee will be applied to all cancellations with no exceptions. This fee is to cover any and all costs and services associated with the cancellation including restocking and design/production time lost.",
        "policy_shipping": "All insurance claims, deadlines and delivery will be carried out by USPS as we use them for all of our delivery services.  \r\n\r\nShipping costs include handling as well and may be upgraded at anytime before purchased items are shipped.  This can be done through conversation at the time the order is placed.  I am willing to rush any order at the purchaser&#39;s request, but it must be approved PRIOR to ordering.  Simply leaving a note on the order form does not guarantee a rush on shipping as it must be purchased.  Tracking/confirmation numbers are provided for every item once it is shipped so that customers can track their packages.  Additional taxes and/or fees may apply.  \r\n\r\nFor international orders, any item that is returned due to failure to pickup or incorrect address information will be assessed return shipping fees that will be paid for by the buyer.\r\n\r\nALL DAMAGES MUST BE REPORTED WITHIN 24 HRS OF RECEIPT OF THE PACKAGE TO BE CONSIDERED FOR A DAMAGE CLAIM.  NO EXCEPTIONS WILL BE MADE.  INSPECT YOUR ITEMS IMMEDIATELY UPON RECEIPT.\r\n\r\nSometimes the postal service is unpredictable and expensive.  However, I don&#39;t expect my customers to take the hit if an order is lost while shipped or broken along the way.  I also don&#39;t want to pay outrageous prices for shipping, and you shouldn&#39;t either.  My orders are shipped as cost efficiently as possible so that everybody wins.  About 95% of the time glass and fragile items arrive intact as they are packaged very carefully before they are shipped.  However, every great once in a while, something will be broken in shipping.  This is out of my hands as I cannot be responsible for how packages are handled once they leave my hands.  To avoid a secondary purchase of items that may be broken in shipping, I add insurance to any package containing glass prior to shipping.  When an item is broken or lost during shipment, the USPS will require an insurance claim to be filed before any replacements can be shipped out.  If any items are broken or lost during shipment, please let me know as soon as possible.  At that point, the customer will be required to send a photo of the damaged products.  My shop will file the claim through the USPS.  About 10 business days after filing the claim, the customer will receive a letter from the USPS requesting that the damaged products, original packaging, all packaging materials, and said letter be presented to their local post office.  This is VERY IMPORTANT, as failure to do so will result in a secondary purchase of the damaged products.  Once the damaged items are presented the claim should be approved and the replacements will be shipped out directly to the customer.",
        "policy_refunds": "Personalized items will not be eligible for return, refund, or exchange as they cannot be resold.  Any damages due to shipping must be reported as soon as items are delivered via email or conversation.  Please be extra careful when leaving notes on personalized items as the personalization on your products will appear EXACTLY as it is noted when ordered.  If a mistake is made in the notes on behalf of the customer, the customer will be responsible for any shipping and/or labor charges, as well as replacement cost to correct the error.",
        "policy_additional": "Our shop puts a great deal of time into writing item descriptions for each product to ensure customers are informed about the product they are purchasing.  We are also glad to answer any questions about products, shipping or anything else prior to purchase when customers ask.  Therefore, orders will not be cancelled or refunded due to customer failure to read these descriptions or ask questions for further clarification.\r\n\r\n• Everything purchased online is a subject to slight color variations due to differences in each monitor&#39;s settings. The color you see on your screen may vary in &quot;temperature&quot;. Each color might look slightly different on different materials.

However, due to my fast turnaround time, they are usually engraved the morning after the order is placed. If your order has been engraved, it will be shipped and ineligible for a cancellation or a refund.\r\n\r\nAs each custom piece is made to order just for you, understandably I cannot accept returns.

Knots and nicks are considered natural for these products\n\nGLASS ~ We order our glasses through American manufacturers and hand engrave each one to order. We check each glass prior to engraving for any noticeable flaws. As each glass is completely unique, please allow for small imperfections on the surface of the glass.\n\nLAYOUTS ~ We will try to honor all engraving requests, however there are some instances where a layout may not work as requested. We retain the right to use our discretion to make slight changes as needed.\n\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING POLICY\nIMPORTANT:\nDue to the changes in USPS International Shipping Policies, Orders that are deemed un-deliverable by the carrier or are not picked up in the allotted amount of time will be treated as abandoned.

Non-payment will result in cancellation and your order will return to my shop.\n\nI accept PayPal and Direct Checkout (where you can pay with: Visa, Master Card, American Express, and Discover cards). \n\nI am located in Arizona so a sales tax of 6.1% is automatically added to all sales shipped to a Arizona address. \n\nFor custom orders I require payment in full before I start handcrafting your order.  Custom orders can not be returned/refunded.  This means I cannot issue a refund for an item with custom lettering or numbering or or a listing that was created as a custom order for you.  This is because I cannot resell items that were specifically made for you.  Thank you for understanding.  \n\nI go out of pocket for all my expenses.  Orders that are canceled or not paid for really hurt my little budget.  If you order custom lettering or numbering and I have already produced the numbering/lettering or the custom product I won&#39;t be able to cancel and refund you order once it has been created.  I&#39;m not a big company but a stay at home mom who makes everything from scratch and goes out of pocket on the supplies for your order.  I appreciate your understanding!",
        "policy_shipping": "Items typically ship in 3-5 business days.  If expedited shipping is needed, please contact me for details.\n\nI ship on Mondays, Tuesdays and sometimes on Wednesdays.  If you request that I ship your item on a specific day I can, but please keep in mind that orders which include live plants need to arrive asap.  Plants do not do well if they end up sitting at the post office, or in a postal truck, on a weekend or postal holiday.  \n\nSHIPPING COSTS:\n**Does it look like Etsy is charging too much for shipping? **  \nShipping charges are calculated by Etsy using total weight, box size, distance traveled from Arizona and shipping method selected.  I don&#39;t make money on shipping!  If shipping charges seem excessive try adding the item to your cart so you can see all the different shipping options.  For bulk orders please contact me and I can look at ways to reduce the cost such as combining your items for shipment, shipping extremely heavy orders with FedEx or using a slower shipping method.  Contact me before your items ship and I will do my best to combine your items for shipping.  I can&#39;t know exact shipping charges until your items are handcrafted and packaged.  If you are overcharged for shipping by Etsy I will refund the difference once your order is packaged for shipment.  :)\n\nWHEN WILL MY ORDER ARRIVE?\nMost items are hand made after your order comes in.  Please check the production time on each item to see how long before I can ship your item.\nI use USPS Priority Mail which usually takes 2-4 business days to arrive depending on your location, but these times are NOT guaranteed by USPS.  You can also purchase Priority Mail Express shipping at checkout.  Sorry but I can&#39;t be responsible if the shipping company delivers late so please order in time for your special event.  \n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF MY PACKAGE IS LOST OR DAMAGED DURING SHIPPING?:\n***I can NOT be responsible for a package once I ship it.***  I&#39;m very sorry if the shipping company looses your package or damages it!  It rarely happens but if it does we will need to file an insurance claim (if you shipped with insurance) and then WAIT for the claim to be paid before I can ship a replacement item.  Sorry but I&#39;m a stay at home mom and I cannot afford to pay for a replacement item and new shipping.  As a potential solution, you can buy a replacement item while we wait on the claim review and I can ship the replacement as soon as possible to your gift recipient.  Then you can use the claim money to pay yourself back for the first item.  Again this is a rare occurrence and I understand your frustration!  I cannot be financially responsible for an item once it leaves my hands.  \n\nPLEASE BUY SHIPPING INSURANCE:\nIf you buy shipping insurance I will replace your bottle if it arrives broken by the post office.  If you shipped with Priority Mail that includes shipping insurance.  If you want to ship with cheaper ground shipping please convo me before your purchase.  We can make you a custom order for a few dollars more to cover me adding shipping insurance to your order.  If your item arrives broken please let me know with in 3 days of arrival so I can file an insurance claim OR for you to receive your claim money faster you can file your own claim and have the check sent directly to you!  Within 3 days of your bottle&#39;s arrival I must also have pictures of the box, tracking  #, pictures of the broken bottle and the packaging.  Once the post office approves the claim (~1-2 weeks) I will send you a new bottle or you can request I send you a refund AFTER the claim is approved.  ** Please do NOT throw away your broken item or the box/packaging material.**  The post office may ask you to bring the broken item and box to the post office so they can see it.  They may reject the insurance claim if you cannot show them those items!  Usually claims go right through but in one case they did ask the buyer to produce those items.  Sorry this is something I wish neither of us ever had to deal with!!!\n \nPlease be aware of climate conditions in your area at the time you order. MOST PLANTS WILL DIE IF EXPOSED TO TEMPERATURES BELOW 40F.  Heat packs can be purchased to travel in your shipment. (NO refunds for buyers who decide to opt out from purchasing a HEAT PACK during the winter months.) I cannot be held responsible for damage in transit due to cold, extreme heat or USPS delays including delayed delivery due to an error in your shipping address. Please be aware of weather conditions when ordering.  Thank you for understanding.\n\nPlease be aware that you are purchasing a living thing and plan accordingly. You need to open the box as soon as it arrives.  Plants left in the dark in a box can change colors, elongate and/or DIE.  \n\nYOU WILL BE SENT A TRACKING NUMBER.  PLEASE WATCH FOR YOUR PLANT&#39;S ARRIVAL AND MAKE SURE IT ISN&#39;T LEFT OUT IN A HOT/COLD MAILBOX/DOORSTEP.  You may be able to have the post office hold your boxes for pickup at your local post office. \n\nIf you ordered an air plant, depending on your location, they may need to be sprayed with non-chlorinated water daily or dipped in water every other day.  So please let your new plant friends out of their box and give them a drink!  As you know, too much or too little water, the wrong soil or incorrect lighting can kill a plant so PLEASE SEE INCLUDED CARE SHEETS. Cactus, succulents and air plants are usually VERY tough but even they need a little love and the right care.  Sorry but after 48 hours of receiving them I cannot issue any refunds.\n\nI carefully wrap the succulents and cushion them in tissue and/or kraft paper for protection. For my potted items, sometimes soil will get loose from the pot. Simply brush off the plant, replace the soil if needed, and lightly pack it around the roots (never plant air plants in soil).  For cactus I would suggest using a plastic spoon to safely replace the soil and handling the cactus every so gently with tongs or leather gloves if you feel the need for direct contact.\n\n\nEnsure that your correct address is listed on Etsy and Paypal and that those addresses match each other because that address is where I&#39;m sending your package unless you specify that this order is a gift and you want it sent to a separate address.    Because of the perishable nature of my products, shipments to incorrect addresses will void any and all guarantees.  If you accidentally ship to an incorrect address, and if the item(s) are returned to me, the buyer would be responsible for the additional shipping charges to re-ship the item.  I can provide you with your tracking number but you will need to contact the shipping company if your package has not arrived or shipped to your old address.  \n\nThe shipping cost is automatically calculated at checkout based on the zip code of the shipping destination provided and includes postage, delivery confirmation, online tracking, packaging/handling and standard USPS insurance. You will receive an email notification when your order has shipped. For orders greater than $100 I can add additional insurance.  You are responsible for letting me know if you&#39;d like a signature confirmation or insurance on your order for an additional cost.  \n\n\nFor items with live plants, shipping is only available to the 48 contiguous states. Live plants cannot ship to APO, AE, or any other military addresses; PO Boxes; any international address.\n\nCUSTOMS AND IMPORT TAXES:\nBuyers are responsible for any customs and import taxes that may apply.  I&#39;ve heard from buyers that countries like the UK do charge an import tax.  Sorry I have no way of finding out if you will be charged an import tax or how much it would be.  I&#39;m not responsible for delays due to customs.",
        "policy_refunds": "Your purchase is refundable if you are unhappy but unfortunately shipping costs and other fees are not refundable.  Just mail back your product, at your expense, and I can send you a different item or I can give you a refund.  The item returned must be in it&#39;s original condition for me to issue you a refund.  Please purchase insurance with your return shipping just in case your item breaks on it&#39;s way back to me.\n\nI take pride in what I make and I want you to be happy!  Please give me the chance to make it right before you leave negative feedback.",
        "policy_additional": "For the sake of my sanity and because I&#39;m chasing 2 very little children, PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME OF THE IMAGES IN MY LISTINGS ARE STOCK PHOTOS.  \r\n\r\nSORRY BUT NO PLANT IS GUARANTEED TO LOOK EXACTLY LIKE ITS LISTING PHOTOS, AND NOT LOOKING LIKE THE PHOTO IS NOT A BASIS FOR A REFUND. I would have to take photos of each plant daily because they are living things and go through changes.  Some cactus, most succulents, and some tillandsias (air plants) change color depending on sun exposure or lack of, hot or cold temperatures, and stress. They also have varying bloom and propagation cycles which will affect their appearance.  So they may be in bloom in the photo but may not arrive in bloom to your house.  No worries, take good care of them and I bet you see them bloom during their next bloom cycle.  The pictures just show you what they will look like when they bloom.\r\n\r\nIf you need a larger quantity than I have listed, please send me a convo and I will quote you a price. \r\n\r\nLabels on glass bottles:  \r\nThe quality of bottle labels can not be guaranteed because we are giving new life to a used bottle that otherwise would have spent nearly 1 million years in a landfill!  True!  If the quality of the label or the color of the foil on the bottle neck is important please let me know and I will do my best to find a bottle that is just right for you.  \r\n\r\nGlass bottles: \r\nEach bottle is a hand-worked piece of art and as such each bottle is slightly different in color, wall thickness, shape....  I spend long hours sanding and polishing my bottles, and I take pride in them, but some will have a small chip here and there on the edge from the LONG and labor intensive process of upcycling your bottle.  These small scratches/dings/chips are usually well concealed when the bottle is planted.  This is glass that was not originally intentioned for it&#39;s new purpose in life so PLEASE HAND WASH AND DO NOT PUT IN THE DISHWASHER.  Enjoy! ",

Long sleeve v-neck pullover in a cream coloured knit emblazoned with the Jack Daniels Old No. 7 logo on the left chest in black embroidery.  A rare promotional piece that likely would only have been given out to salesmen and possibly to high volume liquor store owners.\n\nIn very good vintage condition.  There is a bit of a pull near the logo and a very small spot on the right chest...see close up photos.  These are very minor and don&#39;t detract from the impact of this great jumper at all as they aren&#39;t noticeable except on close inspection. \n\nTagged a Vintage Size Medium.\nMEASUREMENTS (taken flat):\nShoulder to shoulder...approximately 18 1/2 inches (the sleeves are raglan style, so there is no definitive shoulder seam)\nUnderarm to underarm...22 inches\nUnderarm to hem...15 1/2 inches\nNeckline to cuff...32 1/2 inches\n\nDBV-0230",

For details on how to pay with these methods, contact the seller.\n- Other Method",
        "policy_shipping": "PROCESSING TIME\nThe time I need to prepare an order for shipping varies. For details, see individual items.\n\nCUSTOMS AND DUTIES FEES\nBuyers are responsible for any customs or duties fees that may apply. Sellers aren't responsible for delays due to customs",
        "policy_refunds": "I GLADLY ACCEPT CANCELLATIONS\nRequest a cancellation within: 24 hours of purchase\n\nI DON'T ACCEPT RETURNS OR EXCHANGES\nBut please contact me if you have any problems with your order.",
        "policy_additional": "I will only use your shipping and billing address, and contact information\n- To communicate with you about your order\n- To fulfill your order\n- For legal reasons (like paying taxes)\n\nWHAT DOES THE SHIP BY DATE MEAN ON MY ORDER?\nItems will ship (or, if they are digital files, are due) by the ship date shown when you purchase. You can find this date on your Etsy receipt (under You&gt;Purchases and Reviews). Assuming I have all the information for your order and have proof approval, I do my best to guarantee that your order gets out by or on the expected ship date.\n\nI cannot guarantee delivery by any date. Upgrading to 2-3 day priority and 1-2 day express mail should speed up ship times significantly, but USPS does NOT guarantee the number of days items take to ship. \n\nI will do my best to allow ample time for shipping so that your order arrives when you need it. Please know that if your &quot;ship by&quot; date is on a postal holiday, it may ship the next available shipping day.\n\nWHEN WILL MY LOGO ARRIVE?\nLogos proofs are sent about one week before the due date on your Etsy receipt (under You&gt;Purchases and Reviews). I offer unlimited edits and try to work quickly so that you receive your logo on/around the ship date. Some clients do request a wide range of multiple edits, and this is absolutely within the realm of a logo purchase. Please know that, should this occur, it is understood that logo due dates are estimates only. I am responsive to messages, and if you have not received a reply within a day, you may check back in or know that I am working on a proof revision for you.\n\nHOW DOES A LOGO PURCHASE WORK?\nUpon purchasing a logo design, you will receive a questionnaire to help give me good direction about what you envision for your logo. Proofs for logos are sent about one week before logo due dates. Proofs and all conversation are made via Etsy convo, unless the customer requests otherwise.\n\nCUSTOM AND PERSONALIZED ORDERS\nFor custom orders, I will do my best to get you a proof of your order one \nday before the due date (ship-by date) so that you have time to approve it before it ships. Please know that proofs may go out VERY late at night or the morning of the ship date, as I&#39;m often working overtime to fulfill more orders than usual. I will NOT ship your order until I receive approval of the proof sent. If this approval is received past the ship date shown, then your order will ship within one business day of receiving the approval. Just Artin&#39; Around will not be help responsible for items that ship late due to a delay in customer approval of custom work.\n\nWHAT ABOUT SHIPPING?\nAll prints are enclosed in an acid-free sleeve. 5x7 and 8x10 prints are shipped inside a rigid envelope marked &quot;Do Not Bend.&quot; 11x14 and 12x18 prints are shipped in sturdy tubes. Should a small print be ordered with a large print, orders may ship together in a tube. Calling cards and stationery are most often shipped in bubble mailers, but this may vary based on the size of the order.\n\nJust Artin&#39; Around ships USPS to ensure affordability and fast service. \n\nJust Artin&#39; Around is proud to ship worldwide. International orders are shipped as usual and in the order in which they are received. Should customs fees apply, customer is responsible for paying these.\n\nTRACKING SAYS &QUOT;DELIVERED,&QUOT; BUT I DIDN&#39;T RECEIVE MY ORDER.\nIf a tracked item is marked &quot;delivered,&quot; yet a customer claims to have not received the item, Just Artin&#39; Around will not be responsible for replacing the item. I will, however, work with you to get a new print at seller&#39;s cost.\n\nPlease be sure that the shipping address connected to your order is correct. I am not responsible to items shipped to addresses entered incorrectly by buyers.\n\nWHAT IF I WANT YOU TO CUSTOMIZE MY PRINT BEYOND THE OPTIONS IN THE LISTING?\nFor custom requests, please convo me before placing your order. Usually I can accommodate easy changes at no additional cost, but if the changes are time-consuming, I may request that you purchase a $5 or $10 add-on listing for customization.\n\nREFUNDS AND RETURNS\nFor printed and shipped items: custom orders in which the customer has made proof approval (s) will not be refunded unless they are damaged via shipment. I do not accept returns or offer refunds unless an item is damaged. Please be sure to read the item listing carefully so that you know what you are purchasing.  Should an item arrive damaged, I will ensure that a replacement is issued quickly.\n\nFor custom graphic design: orders will not be fully refunded once two proofs have been provided. Partial refunds will be considered based on the time and resources spent designing the files.\n\nALL ABOUT DIGITAL DESIGN\nPlease know that printed colors will vary slightly from what you see on your screen, as will colors from one screen to the next.\n\nOn occasion, I am willing to send CUSTOM files in JPEG format. I will never send a non-custom file to a customer. If a customer needs a print quickly, I can send the file to a local printer to be picked up.\n\nAll files sent will be JPEGs, PNGs, or PDFs (by request). With the exception of logo design, Photoshop files will never be released, as they are my art. Logo PS files may be purchased via the PS Release listing in my logo/branding shop.\n\nNo proofs will be sent before purchase. I will begin working on custom orders once payment has been received.\n\nPLEASE KNOW...\nJust Artin&#39; Around is a one-woman shop, and I am a mother of two very young children. I work very hard to ensure all orders are fulfilled on time. However, certain extenuating circumstances may result in a slight delay of your ship date. These include personal illness, severe weather, and family emergencies. I will do my best to notify you as soon as possible if any delay were to occur.",
